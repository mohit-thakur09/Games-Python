# Fun Python Games

This GitHub project contains a collection of small and interesting Python games designed for fun and entertainment. These games feature tricky logics and provide a great way to pass the time while challenging your skills and creativity. Let's take a closer look at each game:

## Hangman


**Hangman** is a classic word-guessing game that tests your Movie knowledge and guessing skills. In this game:

- You'll be presented with a hidden word represented by dashes.
- Your goal is to guess the letters one by one to uncover the hidden word.
- But beware! You have a limited number of incorrect guesses before the "hangman" is completed.

**Hint**: You might want to brush up on your Movie knowledge for this one!

## Snack-Water-Gun

**Snack-Water-Gun** is a simple yet amusing variation of the popular Rock-Paper-Scissors game. Here's what makes it interesting:

- You play against the computer, which randomly selects one of the three choices: Snack, Water, or Gun.
- The game is based on a set of rules: Snack beats Water, Water beats Gun, and Gun beats Snack.
- Your goal is to make the right choice and outsmart the computer to win.

**Hint**: Keep an eye on the game's logic to increase your chances of winning!
